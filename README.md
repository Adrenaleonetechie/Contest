# For Steven Halim's solution

**Note** some solution (4 - 5) are wrong  which i need to fix during revision and some needs optimization . 
* All the problem names are replaced with their integer code
* For compiling in your own machine if you have DLOCAl flag in your compile then have uj.h file in the same directory or else remove those line from the file.
* I am also preparing some inputs which are tricky for the test_cases.
